CC3200 LaunchPad
================
Connect a TI CC3200 LaunchPad to the IBM Internet of Things Cloud QuickStart service. Then you can visualize the data transmitted by the onboard temperature and accelerometer sensors.

Download the binary package from the [release page](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-simplelink/releases/tag/141014b).

See this [recipe](https://developer.ibm.com/iot/recipes/ti-cc3200-launchpad/) for running the software in this repository.
